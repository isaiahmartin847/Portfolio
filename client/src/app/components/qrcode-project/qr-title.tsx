            <p className="text-center w-fit px-[10%] mt-4">My QR code generator project is a testament to the basics. It&apos;s important to me to peel off all the modern frameworks and build websites with three tried and true technologies to fully understand what&apos;s under the hood of all these frameworks. These days, I feel like everyone is chasing the newest framework and the next big thing. While this is a good thing for the industry, there are a lot of people out there who donâ€™t understand the basics and the underlying principles that all the frameworks are built upon.</p>
